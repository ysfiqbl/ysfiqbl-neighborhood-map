# Neighborhood Map
Click on the map to mark a location. When you mark a location a pop-up window will open up where you can
assign a name to the location and save. Clicking the trash can icon will remove the location from the map.
Clicking an already existing location marker will open up the pop-up window which will contain the name
that was assigned to it as well as the address and stats from Foursquare.

The address and stats are fetched via an AJAX request. If the request is successful the results will be shown, if the request is unsuccessful a message will be displayed.

The saved locations are stored in the browsers local storage therefore you will see an empty map until you
add locations to it.

You can search for locations using the search bar. To toggle a drop down list of the locations click the
list icon to the left of the search bar.
